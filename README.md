Razzword is a pet project for generating random passwords. At the moment Razzword does not offer any security so please use at your own risk. With that said, the project is also a work in progress so there maybe missing features and bugs.

## Project Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
## TODO
- Have favorites be persistant
- Be able to unfavorite a password
